# Face_Generation
GAN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

# Project Overview
In this project, I have defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces.Goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

# Dataset
I'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)] (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.

This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN), and so,I defined deeper networks and trained them for a longer time to get good results. I utilized a GPU for training.
